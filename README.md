# Democode for KitsCon 19.2

This repo contains the code behind the demo shown at KitsCon 19.2. It is hastily cobbled together in order to produce a PoQ and should not be viewed by anyone, but in case you are interested in how a simple AI can be stressed together, it is here for your viewing pleasure.

In case you want to view the demo, it is deployed at https://doverstav.github.io/kitscon192/

The UI "works" on the basis that a monospaced font is shown correctly, so if the map/UI looks weird, there's likely an issue with displaying the font. This demo was mostly tested and intended to run on my own computer, and thus hasn't been properly tested on all browser/platforms.
